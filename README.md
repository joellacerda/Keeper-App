This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Builds the app for production to the `dev` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#surge) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index`.html, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file.

### `npm run preview`

Locally preview production build.
